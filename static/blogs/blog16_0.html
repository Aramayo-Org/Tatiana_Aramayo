<p><strong>Your business might consider cutting its marketing, including email
marketing, in the face of economic uncertainty.</strong></p>

<p><em>3 min. read</em></p>

<p>With the unprecedented rise of inflation, some economists project a
<strong>nearly 50% risk of a U.S. recession within the next 12
months</strong>. This only justifies the fears of the <strong>45% of
U.S. businesses that are “highly concerned”</strong> about an oncoming
economic downturn.</p>

<p>In fact, <strong>half of businesses are preparing to slash their
discretionary marketing spend</strong>. Your business might have also
considered cutting marketing, including email marketing, in the face
of economic uncertainty.</p>

<p>But <strong>reducing your email marketing during the next possible recession
is both a mistake and a missed opportunity</strong>. Focusing your resources
on maintaining a <strong>strong email marketing presence can help your
business not just survive but thrive during a recession</strong>.</p>

<h2>So why email?</h2>

<h3>Fortune Favors the Bold</h3>

<p>Studies have repeatedly shown that <strong>businesses that invest in their
marketing efforts in a recession gain a competitive advantage</strong> over
those that don’t. One well-known case study by <strong>McGraw-Hill
Research</strong> showed companies with <strong>aggressive marketing strategies
grew by 256%</strong> over companies with more timid marketing tactics during
the <strong>1980s recession</strong>.</p>

<p>Also, data from the <strong>2008 recession</strong> showed that businesses that
maintained their marketing output had <strong>3.5 times more brand
visibility</strong> over those that had cut or eliminated their advertising
efforts. In fact, it was <strong>Groupon’s aggressive email campaign</strong> that
allowed the company to make a <strong>$500 million profit and establish
itself as a market leader</strong>.</p>

<h3>It’s Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Despite the internet’s ever-changing landscape and the rise (and
subsequent fall) of many social platforms, <strong>emails are a reliable bet
for marketers to reach their consumers</strong>. So much so that <strong>over 40%
of U.S. businesses rank email marketing in their top three most-valued
channels for growth and retention</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>In <strong>2021</strong>, there were an estimated <strong>4 billion daily email
users</strong>.</li>
<li>That number is expected to rise to <strong>4.6 billion by 2025</strong>.</li>
<li>Nearly <strong>85% of consumers check their email inboxes at least once a
day</strong>, increasing the chance that your intended audience will see
your emails.</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating <strong>standout emails that customers are drawn to helps drive
more engagement and makes your business more competitive</strong>. Plus, you
can <strong>team up with an email marketing solutions provider</strong> to have
experts tailor and manage your content.</p>

<p>Through <strong>email marketing</strong>, customers get to know your business and
you’ll <strong>stay fresh in their minds</strong>. Your business will be able to
reach a <strong>growing and active user base</strong>, which is essential at a time
where <strong>consumers will be more financially cautious</strong>.</p>

<h3>There’s a High Reward</h3>

<p>Already, <strong>marketing to your existing customers yields five to 25
times more than trying to gain new customers</strong>. Specifically, <strong>email
marketing offers your business an average return of $42 for every $1
you spend</strong>.</p>

<p>Email marketing is unique because <strong>these customers have already
agreed to hear from your business and are more open to your marketing
efforts</strong>. This opportunity allows you to <strong>cultivate customer
loyalty</strong>, which is critical when your business is most likely to lose
its customers from a recession.</p>

<p><strong>Focusing your email marketing efforts on maintaining your
relationship with current customers helps ensure they stay your
customers</strong>. Have a dedicated team of <strong>email marketing professionals
on hand to create content that resonates with your customers when
times are hard</strong>.</p>
