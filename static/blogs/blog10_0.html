<p><strong>Enhance customer satisfaction and profitability in lending by
providing accessible information, leveraging digital platforms, and
simplifying the funding process.</strong></p>

<h2>Customers Best Lending Experience</h2>

<p>When a consumer is ready to buy the vehicle of their dreams, <strong>dealers
and lenders need to act fast</strong> to finance a deal and <strong>maximize their
profits</strong>. However, many businesses risk losing customers and money
due to <strong>outdated consumer lending practices</strong> that negatively affect
the buying experience.</p>

<p>In fact, only <strong>56% of customers say their preferred lenders delivered
a secure application process, fast approval, and an easy-to-understand
application</strong>. Whether you’re a dealer or lender, <strong>making your
customers feel satisfied throughout the financing process helps build
your reputation and gives you a competitive edge.</strong></p>

<p>Optimizing a customer’s lending journey lets you <strong>close deals faster,
build better customer relationships, and increase each sale’s
profitability</strong>. Here are <strong>three tips</strong> you can follow to improve
your customer financing:</p>

<h2>1. Provide Accessible Lending Information Online</h2>

<p>In a recent report, the <strong>median age of first-time recreational
vehicle (RV) buyers dropped from 33 to 32</strong>, demonstrating the impact
of <strong>younger buyers entering the RV market</strong>. A <strong>2023 McKinsey
survey</strong> also found that <strong>Gen Z and millennials were almost twice as
likely</strong> to express their intent to purchase a boat or RV compared to
Gen X or boomers.</p>

<p>Considering that <strong>younger customers are more accustomed to online
shopping</strong>, it makes sense to offer <strong>accessible information about
funding options online</strong>. In fact, <strong>51% of Gen Z customers believe
borrowers should learn as much as possible before taking a loan</strong>.</p>

<p>Providing customers with <strong>easy online access to detailed lending
information helps meet expectations</strong>. This builds <strong>positive
reputation and customer loyalty</strong>, increasing the likelihood that
they’ll <strong>return or recommend your business</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. Be Where Your Customers Are</h2>

<p>In <strong>2022</strong>, one study found that <strong>27% of American banking customers
choose to use online-only banks</strong>. This shows how customers are moving
away from traditional, in-person financial services and <strong>prefer
digital financial services for convenience</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s important to have an <strong>established digital financing application
system</strong> that allows you to meet these customers <strong>at their preferred
channel for business</strong>.</p>

<p>When a customer is ready to make a luxury purchase like an <strong>RV or
powersports vehicle</strong>, they may explore financing through the
dealership or get prequalified through their lender
first. Traditionally, this involved <strong>sitting in an office at a
dealership, bank, or credit union</strong> — a process that limits customer
options and your potential reach.</p>

<p>With a <strong>web-based platform</strong>, dealers can manage a <strong>network of
lending partners</strong>, and vice versa. This allows lenders and dealers to
<strong>connect with any customer financing digitally</strong> through the
platform. You can <strong>benefit from both indirect and direct lending</strong>
while eliminating the need for customers to finance in person.</p>

<h2>3. Simplify Your Customer Funding Experience</h2>

<p>One customer described themselves as <strong>“in the dark” at nearly every
step</strong> of their journey buying an RV. They were responsible for
coordinating with <strong>16 people across the dealer, OEM, and financing
office</strong> to complete their purchase.</p>

<p>This complicated sales experience puts too much stress and
responsibility on customers and <strong>increases the risk of the sale
falling through</strong>. An <strong>inefficient, labor-intensive lending process
frustrates customers</strong> and <strong>stunts your profit potential</strong>.</p>

<p>Don’t let a complicated lending experience confuse customers or cost
you a sale. It’s vital to <strong>streamline your funding process to
minimize delays and maximize customer satisfaction</strong>. Using a
<strong>lending workflow solution</strong> can make your customer funding
experience <strong>fast and easy</strong>.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>You can give your customers a <strong>superior lending experience</strong> by:</p>

<ul>
<li>Making financing options easily <strong>accessible</strong></li>
<li>Meeting customers through a <strong>convenient digital network</strong></li>
<li><strong>Simplifying the funding process</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This optimizes the <strong>customer’s lending journey</strong> and helps you
<strong>build better customer relationships, increase profits, and close
deals faster.</strong></p>
