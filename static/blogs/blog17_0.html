<p><strong>If your small bank or credit union wants to maximize growth and
build a strong loyal customer base, you’ll need a strong marketing
strategy.</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to growing any small financial institution, knowing how
to market is critical to getting the best results. In fact,
<strong>U.S. businesses rank email marketing, advertising, and social/paid
social media in their top three most valued channels for growth and
retention</strong>.</p>

<p>Furthermore, <strong>content marketing helps financial marketers spread
brand awareness, reach their target audience, and increase web
traffic</strong>. If your small bank or credit union wants to maximize growth
and build a strong loyal customer base, you’ll need a <strong>strong
marketing strategy</strong>.</p>

<p>Here are <strong>four tips</strong> to ensure your marketing has a <strong>big impact on
your small financial institution</strong>.</p>

<h2>Know Your Audience</h2>

<p>Do you know your current customers? How do you make them loyal to your
business? Do you know how to stand out to new customers so they choose
your financial institution over your competitors? These are just a few
of the questions you need to answer to develop an effective marketing
strategy.</p>

<p><strong>Understanding your target audience is key</strong> to growing your business
and fostering a loyal customer base. If you want to see your marketing
efforts pay off, <strong>tailor your marketing content to resonate with your
audience</strong>.</p>

<p>Tracking data points like <strong>email open and click-through rates or the
number of calls made to an advertised phone number</strong> helps give your
business useful insights into your customers’ behavior. This snapshot
of information can help your business <strong>overcome any uncertainty over
the impact of your marketing efforts</strong>.</p>

<p>One easy and efficient way to collect data is through <strong>email
marketing</strong>, where you can analyze how your target audience responds
to different content and make better informed marketing
decisions. Access to <strong>actionable reports gives you the opportunity to
prioritize the metrics that matter most for your business and lets you
analyze customer behavior throughout the sales cycle</strong>.</p>

<h2>Make Time for Marketing</h2>

<p>Figuring out when to write marketing content while juggling a busy
schedule is one of the <strong>biggest hurdles banking and credit union
professionals face</strong>. Many large financial institutions have a
dedicated marketing team equipped with the manpower, time, and
resources to plan and produce timely marketing content.</p>

<p>In contrast, your <strong>smaller bank or credit union might not even have a
dedicated marketing team</strong>, which makes producing consistent marketing
content a more challenging task than at a larger bank or credit
union. Each person on your team is likely <strong>juggling multiple
day-to-day tasks and projects needed to help keep your small financial
business running</strong>. These daily responsibilities might make marketing
seem just out of reach for your team.</p>

<p>So how can you make time for marketing without sacrificing other
projects? By focusing on <strong>creating content that requires less time
and energy, like email marketing</strong>. An <strong>email marketing campaign can
be automated and outsourced to a vendor partner</strong>, which saves
time. This way, your team can output more personalized content in a
timely manner without neglecting any of their other responsibilities.</p>

<h2>Work Smarter When Creating Content</h2>

<p>While making sure you have enough content is tricky with a busy
schedule, ensuring your content is <strong>creative and stands out from your
competitors requires even more work</strong>. Knowing how to efficiently
create interesting, new, and diverse content that grabs your
audience’s attention is the cornerstone of marketing.</p>

<p>But consistently coming up with new topics that fit your business and
resonate with your audience requires <strong>dedicated time and
research</strong>. And that’s not to mention the work needed to <strong>convert
these topics into fleshed-out content</strong> you can use in your marketing
emails, social posts, newsletters, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Marketing is a lot of work</strong>, but you can make this job easier for
your team by getting help from a <strong>digital marketing service</strong>. A
dedicated team of experts acts as an <strong>organic extension to your
marketing team</strong> so you won’t have to worry about running out of
content ideas.</p>

<p>These <strong>professional content creators know your industry and can write
for your small financial institution quickly and efficiently</strong>. Your
marketing team will have more manpower and resources to ensure your
content stays fresh and relevant. Plus, these experts can help
<strong>tailor your marketing content to engage your audience</strong>.</p>

<h2>Have a Robust Editing Process</h2>

<p><strong>Becoming a trusted voice to your customers means making a good
impression every time</strong> they open one of your emails, view an ad, or
see any of your marketing content. You should consistently make not
only a variety of content but also <strong>quality content</strong>.</p>

<p>This means checking that your marketing content reflects the <strong>same
standards as any other project in your bank or credit
union</strong>. Customers will notice when ads have a <strong>broken link, when an
email is riddled with typos, or when an article lists incorrect or
false information</strong>.</p>

<p>To build a good reputation, send your marketing through a <strong>thorough
editing process where it is checked and rechecked for mistakes before
being published</strong>. Plus, you can make sure all your content meets
<strong>regulatory and compliance standards</strong>.</p>

<p>Don’t let simple errors turn off your customers. <strong>Make it a habit to
review your work and send it to another editor</strong>. If your team
struggles to review all your content thoroughly, consulting a <strong>team
of professional writers</strong> can help your business produce engaging and
compliant content that has already gone through review.</p>

<p><strong>Don’t underestimate the importance of great marketing.</strong> Follow
these tips so your marketing can <strong>make a big impact on your small
financial institution’s growth.</strong></p>
