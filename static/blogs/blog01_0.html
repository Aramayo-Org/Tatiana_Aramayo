<p><strong>Learn about the key features your dealership needs to drive customers to your service department.</strong></p>

<p><em>By MOGO</em> <br> <em>2 min. read</em></p>

<h2>Where do your customers go to service their vehicles?</h2>

<p>In <strong>2021, 34% of consumers</strong> preferred using their dealership’s service center. While that number isn’t terrible, <strong>franchise dealers are still
losing $214 billion of potential revenue</strong>. Your dealership needs to provide a <strong>competitive customer service experience</strong> to take advantage of this
segment of the market.</p>

<p>To drive more customers towards your service department, it’s important to implement <strong>fast, convenient, and personalized features</strong> that improve
customers’ service experience in your dealership.</p>

<h2>Quick and Easy Process</h2>

<p><strong>Time is money</strong>, and your dealership can’t afford to waste a customer’s time if you want to build a long-term relationship. As many as <strong>1 in 4
customers express frustration</strong> over longer-than-expected service times from their dealerships.</p>

<p>If you want customers to pick your dealership over other repair shops, make servicing their vehicles <strong>fast, reliable, and streamlined</strong>. This can
include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Installing a robust <strong>key management system</strong> that identifies who has the customer’s keys and where they are for a more efficient key control
process.</li>
<li>Quickly <strong>tracking the location</strong> of a customer’s vehicle at your dealership using a <strong>GPS tracking service</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Integrating both key control and vehicle tracking</strong> into one seamless solution to reduce human error and strengthen security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Modern, Personalized Service</h2>

<p>Customers expect dealerships to offer <strong>convenient, personalized customer service</strong>. Over <strong>40% of customers prefer service centers</strong> that send out
simple text message reminders for upcoming appointments, and most list <strong>online access to their vehicle service history</strong> as a critical digital
feature.</p>

<p>With <strong>personalized online and mobile features</strong>, your service center will stand out against the competition. For example, using a <strong>digital vehicle
tracking service</strong> lets your dealership engage with each customer on an individual basis. This service can include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sending your customers <strong>perfectly timed vehicle service alerts</strong> via text or email based on their vehicle’s <strong>actual mileage</strong> and not just an
estimate.</li>
<li>Letting your customers <strong>track their vehicle’s location</strong> and <strong>view vehicle reports online</strong> or through a mobile app.</li>
<li>Instantly <strong>alerting customers with notifications</strong>, such as <strong>geofence boundaries or speed alerts</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p><strong>Prove to customers that your dealership offers the best vehicle service experience</strong> with <strong>convenient reminders, fast service time, and digital
vehicle monitoring features</strong>.</p>
