    <p><strong>Discover key RV trends for summer 2023 and learn how lenders can
	capitalize on leisure travel demand to gain a competitive edge.</strong></p>

    <p><em>By Chet Heughan</em> <br> <em>3 min. read</em></p>

    <h2>RV Trends This Summer</h2>

    <p>As temperatures rise, the summer season is kicking in, bringing with
      it <strong>National Go RVing Day on June 10</strong>. Let’s take a look at what’s
      going on in the RV industry this year and see what your bank or credit
      union should keep in mind to <strong>gain a competitive advantage</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Keep an Eye on Leisure Travel Demand</h2>

    <p>If <strong>2022</strong> was a hot year for leisure travel demand, then <strong>2023 has
	the potential to be even hotter</strong> for RV dealers and lenders that
      learn how to win the traveler market. Here’s why:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>74% of 2022 campers plan to camp again in the future.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>72% of parents are planning more trips this year than last</strong>, with
	<strong>45% more interested than other adults in traveling by RV.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>64% of couples without kids are more interested in traveling long
	  distances in an RV.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Nearly 39% of Americans plan to travel more than 250 miles this
	  summer.</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This data paints a potentially <strong>lucrative opportunity for RV dealers
	and lenders</strong>. With more travelers planning to travel by RV, both
      dealers and lenders should jump on this opportunity to <strong>appeal to
	families and campers looking to hit the road this summer</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Don’t Stress About Shrinking RV Shipments</h2>

    <p>The hard truth is, <strong>RV shipments have declined since the industry’s
	all-time high in 2021 and early 2022</strong>. Overall, <strong>RV shipments in
	2023 are expected to shrink by 21%</strong> due to <strong>rising interest rates,
	recession concerns, and record-high shipments in previous years</strong>.</p>

    <p>Key figures:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Total RV shipments dropped by <strong>54.3% (78,600 units)</strong> from January
	to March compared to the same time last year.</li>
      <li>Retail registrations in the same timeframe saw only a <strong>25.7%
	  decline (82,201 registrations)</strong> compared to 2022.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Retail sales outpacing shipments</strong> implies that dealerships are
      selling <strong>excess inventory rather than ordering new units</strong>. Plus,
      while <strong>national shipments may be slowing down</strong>, many <strong>local dealers
	are reporting increased sales</strong>, including in <strong>Raleigh, NC, and
	Colorado Springs, CO</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Expect Future Growth in the RV Industry</h2>

    <p>The good news is, even though the RV industry is having a <strong>slump in
	2023</strong>, its <strong>overall trajectory remains positive</strong>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Despite economic challenges impacting this year’s shipments and
	sales forecasts, <strong>consumer interest in RV ownership remains
	  strong</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Get Your Lending Process Ready to Meet Demand</h2>

    <p>What do these trends mean for your <strong>bank or credit union</strong>?</p>

    <p>The RV industry has already proven to be a <strong>strong and profitable
	market</strong> for lenders who know how to <strong>capitalize on its unique
	qualities</strong>. If you want to <strong>take advantage of any rise in summer
	sales</strong> and continue growing upwards, you’ll need to position yourself
      <strong>competitively against other lenders in your area</strong>.</p>

    <p>Gain a <strong>competitive advantage</strong> by using a workflow solution like
      <strong>AppOne’s web-based platform</strong>, which gives you <strong>access to an
	established network of dealerships</strong> in your area. This tool can help
      <strong>streamline your financial institution’s consumer lending process</strong>
      so you can enjoy a <strong>profitable summer season</strong>.</p>
