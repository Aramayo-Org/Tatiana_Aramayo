<h1>Why Investing in Financial Literacy Helps Your Bottom Line</h1>

<p><strong>April is in full swing, which means National Financial Literacy Month is here once again.</strong></p>

<p>April is in full swing, which means <strong>National Financial Literacy
Month</strong> is here once again. For the past <strong>18 years</strong>, this month has
been an invitation for <strong>banks and credit unions to do their part in
educating Americans, young and old, about personal finance</strong>.</p>

<p>But data shows that the <strong>financial literacy rate in American adults
has decreased from 42% to 34% from 2009 to 2018</strong>. The <strong>average
number of financial questions Americans could answer correctly dropped
14% from 2009 to 2021</strong>.</p>

<p>What does this mean for your bank or credit union? Why should you
invest time and money in building your customers’ financial literacy?
Because <strong>educating them improves your profit potential and improves
customer loyalty</strong>. Let’s explore why.</p>

<h2>Financial Literacy Is Good for Business</h2>

<p>Customers with <strong>higher financial literacy make better money
decisions</strong> over customers with lower financial literacy. A <strong>2021
national study</strong> found that:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>53% of highly financially literate respondents spent less than
their income</strong></li>
<li><strong>65% had set aside an emergency fund</strong></li>
<li><strong>70% opened a retirement account</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Less than half of those with poor financial literacy engaged in
similar actions.</p>

<p>Additionally, <strong>credit unions that offered financial education had a
credit card delinquency ratio of 1.05%</strong>, a full <strong>40 basis points
below those who didn’t</strong>. Customers who understand how to manage their
personal finances are <strong>more reliable and less likely to get
overwhelmed with debt</strong> and fall into <strong>delinquency or bankruptcy</strong>.</p>

<p>Educating people on financial topics means they’re a <strong>lower financial
risk</strong> to your bank or credit union. Your customers are <strong>more likely
to keep more money in the bank, use more savings and investment
products, and offer a higher return on investment</strong> to your
institution when they’re financially literate.</p>

<h2>Customers Want to Be Financially Literate</h2>

<p>Over <strong>60% of U.S. consumers put financial education as the most
important supplementary graduation requirement</strong>. Plus, more than
<strong>50% would teach their younger selves basic money management</strong>, the
value of saving money, and how to set and work toward financial goals.</p>

<p>While you can’t help your customers go back in time, it’s never too
late to <strong>reach out and help your customers learn about managing their
personal finances</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, <strong>60% of US banking customers want their banks to provide
personalized financial advice</strong>. One study found that banks that sent
customers advice on how to avoid fees were able to <strong>increase
satisfaction scores by 166 points and trust scores by 172 points on a
1,000-point scale</strong>.</p>

<p>You can <strong>nurture strong relationships with your customers by
providing the information and resources they need to improve their
financial literacy</strong>. This helps your customers <strong>feel more satisfied
with your services and want to continue to do business</strong> with your
bank or credit union.</p>

<h2>Ready to Start Educating Your Customers?</h2>

<p>Nearly <strong>30% of Americans are uncomfortable asking questions about
finances or financial products</strong>. That’s why it’s important to <strong>make
the first step when opening dialogue with your customers and
members</strong>.</p>

<p>Using a <strong>regular email newsletter</strong> lets you tailor relevant
financial topics to your audience and <strong>guide them to the answers they
need to better manage their finances</strong>. Engaging your customers helps
your bank or credit union <strong>increase profit potential, lower risk, and
improve customer satisfaction</strong>.</p>

<p>Both during <strong>National Financial Literacy Month</strong> and throughout the
year, <strong>consistent communication is important to see the benefits
financial literacy brings</strong>.</p>
