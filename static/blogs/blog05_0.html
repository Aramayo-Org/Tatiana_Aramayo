<p><strong>Learn four key digital strategies to help your credit union stay
competitive, improve efficiency, and enhance member experience in
today's tech-driven financial landscape.</strong></p>

<p><em>By Chet Heughan</em> <br> <em>3 min. read</em></p>

<h2>Digital Best Practices</h2>

<p>From <strong>2020 to 2021</strong>, credit union members’ <strong>customer satisfaction
dropped 2%</strong>. For digital and online bank members, however, that rate
<strong>rose 2%</strong>. Though not a dramatic difference, this shift reflects how
customers now expect their financial institutions (FIs) to offer more
<strong>tech-friendly ecosystems</strong>.</p>

<p>Customers want FIs to provide modern products and services that are
<strong>convenient and easy to use</strong> in today’s digital landscape. In fact,
one study found that <strong>30% of millennials and 24% of Gen Xers</strong> who
are credit union members were <strong>very likely to leave</strong> their current
credit unions for more <strong>innovative competitors</strong>.</p>

<p>Integrating new technology into your <strong>dealership loan process</strong>
improves your credit union members’ experience. This helps you both
<strong>retain current members</strong> and more easily <strong>gain new ones</strong>.</p>

<p>Knowing where and how to use the best tools to make your credit union
more <strong>efficient, competitive, and profitable</strong> is vital. Give your
credit union an edge over competitors by following these best
practices.</p>

<h2>1. Use Technology to Be More Efficient</h2>

<p>On average, a <strong>bank can have five to 10 times the number of
employees</strong> and <strong>six to 22 times as many assets</strong> as a credit
union. Adopting technology to improve your team’s <strong>efficiency without
needing to hire more staff</strong> is critical when competing against larger
institutions.</p>

<p>Even now, employees manually perform over <strong>50% of loan process
tasks</strong>. This approach to consumer lending is a <strong>labor-intensive
process</strong> that requires hours to complete and has a <strong>high margin of
error</strong>.</p>

<p>Implementing technology that <strong>automates workflows</strong>, like credit
analyses or loan approvals, and <strong>digitizes data management</strong> will
reduce the amount of work your staff wastes performing simple tasks
and fixing mistakes.</p>

<p>This kind of technology is considered a <strong>sales force multiplier</strong>,
which means your team will be able to <strong>get more work done in less
time</strong>, increasing your credit union’s <strong>productivity and profit</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. Move Services Online to Attract More Customers</h2>

<p>Due to the pandemic, customers were forced to <strong>manage their finances
online</strong>. Most have <strong>no plans to return to old habits</strong>. For example,
after trying digital banking:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>63% of consumers preferred to manage their finances online</strong></li>
<li><strong>59% planned to continue using digital tools</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Utilizing a <strong>web-based platform that connects lenders and dealers</strong>
lets your credit union connect to more customers who are already
committed to making a purchase at the dealership. This allows both
potential and current members to easily <strong>view your lending offer
side-by-side with other big-name lenders</strong>.</p>

<p>By using an <strong>online tool</strong>, your credit union can <strong>meet its members
where they shop</strong>. You’ll be able to <strong>reach more customers</strong> and grow
your <strong>sales potential without needing to invest in a larger sales
force</strong>.</p>

<h2>3. Go Digital to Eliminate Human Error</h2>

<p>Despite the push toward digital, the amount of <strong>paperwork used in a
dealership loan process can be massive</strong>. If you were to lay out those
loan documents end to end, it would add up to <strong>nearly 39 feet of
paper for every purchase</strong> at the dealership.</p>

<p><strong>Digitizing your forms management and application process reduces the
risk of errors</strong> and delays in your lending process. Using a
<strong>centralized network</strong> that connects lenders, dealers, and customers
can <strong>eliminate any dealer contracting errors and returned
contracts</strong>.</p>

<p>People make mistakes — it’s an inevitable reality every business must
account for. <strong>Using paper to manage data and documents makes it
difficult for those mistakes to be caught and fixed</strong> in a timely
manner. By cutting paper out of the equation, your credit union will
be able to <strong>save time and money</strong>.</p>

<h2>4. Embrace Automation to Improve Member Experience</h2>

<p>One of the biggest problems lenders face today with consumer lending
is <strong>how much time employees waste on non-core tasks</strong>. They spend up
to <strong>30-40% of their lending resource time performing tasks</strong> that
could easily be automated, such as credit analysis or loan document
compliance.</p>

<p>By <strong>2024</strong>, organizations that provide better <strong>digital integration
into their business operations</strong> are predicted to <strong>outperform
competitors by 25% in customer satisfaction</strong>. Integrating automation
tools helps <strong>speed up your lending process</strong> and <strong>improve your
members’ customer service experience</strong>.</p>

<p>Using a <strong>web-based platform, like AppOne</strong>, streamlines and automates
your consumer lending process, giving your credit union a
<strong>competitive edge by processing credit applications quickly and
accurately</strong>.</p>
