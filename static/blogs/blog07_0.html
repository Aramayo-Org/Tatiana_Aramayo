<p><strong>How to transition to digital lending to enhance efficiency, reduce
errors, and boost profitability for dealerships and lenders in the
luxury vehicle market.</strong></p>

<p><em>By Chet Heughan</em> <br> <em>4 min. read</em></p>

<h2>Manual Lending</h2>

<p>You might think getting a sale is the biggest hurdle when selling
<strong>luxury products like RVs, powersports vehicles, or marine
vehicles</strong>. But securing a customer’s buy-in is often the <strong>easiest
part of the sales process</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s the next step — <strong>getting the deal funded</strong> — where many sales
<strong>lose profitability</strong>. This is due to the <strong>inefficient and outdated
consumer lending practices</strong> many dealers and their lender partners
have, specifically with the use of <strong>traditional paper-based systems</strong>
in our tech-oriented world.</p>

<p>Customers want to own the vehicle of their dreams, dealerships want to
sell their inventory, and lenders want to finance these deals. Having
an <strong>inefficient, disjointed consumer lending process</strong> means both
dealers and lenders risk <strong>losing revenue</strong>.</p>

<h2>Why Is Manual Lending Problematic?</h2>

<p>Traditionally, consumer lending is an <strong>arduous task</strong> that involves
manual data collection, a labor-intensive review of applications, and
<strong>frequent errors and delays</strong>. The whole process heavily depends on
<strong>how accurate data is</strong> and <strong>how efficiently it’s transferred
between departments</strong>.</p>

<p>Any issues at any step can delay the process by <strong>days or even
weeks</strong>. Some of the biggest flaws in the manual consumer lending
process include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Customers must <strong>physically provide documents</strong> (driver’s license,
paystubs, proof of residence, etc.) just to start the process.</li>
<li>Completion depends on <strong>all parties submitting documents on time and
error-free</strong>.</li>
<li>Compliance requires <strong>using the latest forms for transactions</strong>,
which can change by lender, year, or state.</li>
<li><strong>Manual review of creditworthiness</strong> takes as long for simple as
for complex applications.</li>
<li>Time spent reviewing applications is <strong>wasted when a customer is
later deemed ineligible</strong>.</li>
<li>Lack of <strong>synchronization between systems</strong> creates inefficiencies
and risks.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple manual data entries</strong> by both dealer and loan officer
increase errors.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, <strong>paper-based lending is tedious</strong> and consumes time, labor,
and money — not to mention resources wasted on deals that fall
through.</p>

<h2>The Best Financial Institutions Are Going Digital</h2>

<p>In <strong>2022</strong>, McKinsey & Company released data showing <strong>top performers
in financial services had over 30% revenue growth</strong>, compared to <strong>5%
for average performers</strong>. These top performers had <strong>over 90%
end-to-end digital ecosystems</strong>, while average performers had only
<strong>30-35%</strong>.</p>

<p>By embracing technology, top performers improved operational
excellence and increased profitability. This has created a <strong>widening
gap between top and bottom performers</strong>, where the <strong>cost of not
embracing technology is falling behind competitors</strong>.</p>

<p>Almost <strong>60% of consumers are willing to pay more</strong> for parts of a
sale offered online — such as reviewing and selecting F&I products or
signing paperwork digitally. Adopting new technologies will
<strong>streamline your lending process and increase profits</strong>, whether
you’re a dealer or lender.</p>

<h2>The Automation Advantage</h2>

<p>With <strong>automated lending workflows</strong>, you can streamline credit
analyses or loan approvals. Automation reduces the labor burden of
forms management and delivers a <strong>better customer experience</strong>.</p>

<p>For example, a dealer solutions consultant at <strong>Volkswagen Credit</strong>
shared how <strong>eContracting reduced document processing time by
two-thirds</strong> and cut <strong>23% of package reworks</strong>.</p>

<p>Automation allows dealers and lenders to:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Digitize forms management</strong> to fill out the right documents
quickly and accurately.</li>
<li><strong>Eliminate human error</strong> and reduce recontracting rates.</li>
<li>Provide customers a <strong>quick, convenient application process</strong> at
their own pace.</li>
<li>Reduce time spent reviewing credit applications while <strong>improving
accuracy</strong>.</li>
<li>Stay in compliance through <strong>automated forms management</strong>.</li>
<li>Create a <strong>centralized data network</strong> between dealership and lender
to maintain consistency.</li>
<li>Lower the amount of <strong>contracts in transit</strong>, accelerating payments
and freeing time for more important deals.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p><strong>Manual lending is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and fraught with
errors.</strong> Digitization and automation save time, resources, profits,
and improve customer relationships.</p>

<p>Whether you’re a dealer or a lender, <strong>now is the time to automate the
lending process</strong> and make your business <strong>more profitable and
competitive</strong>.</p>
