    <p><strong>Learn how you can leverage GPS vehicle tracking to increase your profits throughout the
	dealership.</strong></p>

    <p><em>By MOGO</em> <br> <em>2 min. read</em></p>

    <h2>Dealers can put away their crystal ball</h2>

    <p>It’s impossible to predict how the economy, supply chain issues, and buying habits will affect
      supply and demand. To protect your dealership’s revenue, it’s important to <strong>diversify your revenue
	streams</strong>.</p>

    <p>How do you unlock new revenue? With <strong>GPS tracking and recovery</strong>. Let’s discuss how.</p>

    <h2>Accessories Sales</h2>

    <p>The <strong>accessories market</strong> has been steadily increasing since <strong>2014</strong>, and it’s currently worth
      <strong>$49 billion</strong>. By <strong>2024</strong>, it’s expected to grow to <strong>$57 billion</strong>.</p>

    <p>Dealerships currently capture only <strong>14% of the overall market</strong>, so there’s a lot of revenue
      potential there. Automotive retailers are in a good position to increase their market share because
      they have a <strong>captive audience with every customer</strong> that interacts with the dealership.</p>

    <p>Why focus on selling <strong>GPS trackers specifically</strong>?  In <strong>2020</strong>, alarms, remote starts, and
      recovery accessories were the <strong>fourth most sold accessories</strong>. <strong>Protection products</strong> are popular
      with customers, and they’re lucrative for dealers too. <strong>Electronics like GPS trackers have an 81%
	profit margin.</strong></p>

    <p>By selling <strong>vehicle theft recovery service</strong>, you can open <strong>new F&I revenue</strong> and increase
      <strong>profits per vehicle</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Service Revenue</h2>

    <p>Unlike other accessories like <strong>floor mats, roof racks, or spoilers</strong>, <strong>GPS trackers can create
	recurring revenue</strong> for the dealership in the <strong>service department</strong>.</p>

    <p>After a customer purchases a vehicle with a GPS unit installed, you can automatically send them
      <strong>timely maintenance alerts via text or email</strong>. These alerts are based upon the vehicle’s <strong>actual
	mileage</strong>. When planning your marketing campaigns, you won’t have to guess when the customer hits a
      new maintenance milestone.</p>

    <p>By making it easier for customers to stay on top of servicing their vehicles, you’ll <strong>build trust</strong>
      with them while <strong>increasing revenue</strong>. Every vehicle sale represents only <strong>one transaction</strong>, but
      <strong>return business in the service department increases each customer’s lifetime value</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Future Sales</h2>

    <p>Offering customers an <strong>add-on that provides long-term value</strong> drives future business not just for
      service but for sales as well. When customers are satisfied with their purchase and your dealership
      is top of mind — another benefit of sending <strong>regular maintenance alerts</strong> — they’re more likely to
      return to your store when they’re ready to purchase another vehicle.</p>

    <p>No matter what’s happening in the automotive retailing industry, <strong>leverage GPS vehicle tracking to
	boost your profits throughout the dealership.</strong></p>
