    <p><strong>Despite years of responsibility creep, bank professionals must make
	marketing a priority, both to retain existing customers and target
	potential new ones. How do you make time for marketing?</strong></p>

    <p><em>4 min. read</em></p>

    <h2>Businessman looking at watch</h2>

    <p>Ever heard of mission creep? It refers to the gradual expansion of a
      project or mission beyond its original scope, focus, or goals.</p>

    <p>If you can’t relate to that, you can almost certainly relate to this:
      <strong>responsibility creep.</strong> That is, the tendency for an employee’s
      responsibilities to grow over time, encompassing more and more tasks
      outside of their original job description. Usually, responsibility
      creep comes without a commensurate increase in income or status.</p>

    <p>Well, it turns out mission creep and responsibility creep are
      essentially the same thing. They both highlight why it’s so hard for
      professionals in the banking industry to devote much, if any, time to
      marketing: because there’s simply no time in their day to spare!</p>

    <p>And yet, they must make marketing a priority, both to <strong>retain
	existing customers</strong> and <strong>target potential new ones</strong>. It must also
      be <strong>consistent and relevant</strong> — an unfocused, on-again, off-again
      approach won’t work.</p>

    <p>So how do you create time to market when your daily schedule doesn’t
      allow for it? One of the best solutions for this is <strong>email
	marketing</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Power of Email Marketing</h2>

    <p>Email marketing has a unique value for the banking and financial
      industries. It can deliver <strong>targeted, informative content</strong> while
      meeting <strong>compliance standards</strong>. It requires <strong>less time and work</strong>
      than most other marketing channels. And even today, it continues to
      deliver <strong>impressive open and conversion rates across all
	industries.</strong></p>

    <p>But how exactly does email marketing dovetail with a banking
      professional’s lack of free time?</p>

    <p>First, let’s consider the following <strong>best practices of marketing</strong>
      for those with little to no downtime in a workday. Then, we’ll see how
      email marketing meets each of these needs.</p>

    <h3>Make a plan.</h3>

    <p>Decide what percentage of your time you can devote to marketing. You
      may have to have some tough conversations and make difficult choices
      to eliminate or delegate less essential job functions to create a
      reasonable starting point.</p>

    <h3>Work smarter, not harder.</h3>

    <p>Lean into what you already know and embrace your competencies. Once
      your campaign is in motion, let it run and follow the cycle (creation,
      launch, review, and re-evaluation).</p>

    <h3>Remember the 80/20 rule.</h3>

    <p>A good rule of thumb to follow: <strong>Only 20 percent of your customers
	need a new product or service at any given moment, so 80 percent of
	your marketing should be focused on retention.</strong> That means having a
      <strong>data-driven approach</strong> to boosting brand awareness and developing
      content that matches the needs and interests of your existing customer
      base.</p>

    <h3>Take advantage of data.</h3>

    <p>Useful data provides insights. It teaches you something about your
      marketing or about your customers. Insights lead to improved
      marketing, which leads to better results and saved time.</p>

    <h3>Put your content to work.</h3>

    <p>Creating the actual content of your campaigns is the most important
      step to building a winning campaign. It takes time and knowledge, and
      it must be both <strong>compliant and engaging</strong>. Remember your priorities
      and the insights you’ve gleaned from your data, then craft content
      that grabs a customer’s attention, appeals to their interests or life
      situation, and prompts a specific action.</p>

    <p>Email marketing achieves each of these goals. First, the process of
      running an <strong>email marketing campaign can be largely automated and
	outsourced</strong> to a vendor partner, making it an attractive option for
      those with little time to waste. Automating big pieces of the process
      also makes it easier to resist micromanaging and tinkering with the
      campaign once it’s out the door.</p>

    <p>Second, the format and method of delivery make <strong>adhering to the 80/20
	rule relatively easy</strong>. You can customize your messaging for the
      category of customer you’re targeting, in effect running retention and
      lead generation campaigns simultaneously.</p>

    <p>This channel also returns <strong>useful data points</strong>, since you’ll have
      ready access to <strong>open and click-through rates, phone calls from
	advertised phone numbers, and a number of other sources</strong>. When your
      campaigns run on <strong>data-driven insights into customer behavior</strong>,
      you’ll spend less time micromanaging strategy changes.</p>

    <p>Finally, <strong>content is the cornerstone of every campaign.</strong> Email
      marketing is focused entirely around your content, or the messaging
      you want to target specific customer segments with. Not only that, but
      email marketing allows for a degree of <strong>personalization that most
	other channels and platforms struggle to match.</strong> Consider that <strong>91
	percent of consumers are more likely to purchase goods and services
	from brands that provide tailored offers and recommendations specific
	to them.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s not easy to market effectively when you have little to no free
      time in a given work day. <strong>Email marketing is perfectly suited for
	that task, featuring a high degree of automation, customization, and
	effectiveness.</strong></p>

    <p>Put this solution to work for you today to <strong>make marketing your brand
	the priority it deserves to be.</strong></p>
