    <p><strong>If you’ve ever gotten overwhelmed with the influx of digital
	marketing content every time you go online, then so can your
	customers.</strong></p>

    <p><em>3 min. read</em></p>

    <p>Between browsing websites, social media, and emails, how many online
      marketing messages or advertisements do you see every day? <strong>Tens?
	Hundreds? Thousands?</strong> If you’ve ever gotten overwhelmed with the
      influx of digital marketing content every time you go online, then so
      can your customers.</p>

    <p>In fact, <strong>over 70% of consumers have stated that they want to receive
	fewer marketing messages in 2023 than in 2022</strong>, with <strong>nearly 30%
	feeling bombarded with marketing messages every day</strong>. Furthermore,
      consumers are experiencing burnout from excessive digital use, called
      <strong>digital fatigue</strong>, which spells trouble for your email marketing
      efforts.</p>

    <p>With the increasing flood of emails in their inboxes and less time or
      energy to review all of it, <strong>customers are getting pickier with the
	emails they choose to open</strong>. Now your emails are competing with every
      other email in your reader’s inbox. It’s essential for your marketing
      team to learn how to keep your exhausted audience engaged.</p>

    <p>Here are some important things to keep in mind to help your email
      marketing efforts <strong>overcome your audience’s digital fatigue</strong>:</p>

    <h2>Timing Is Everything</h2>

    <p>You might think sending more emails increases the chances that a
      customer will engage with one of your emails over another company’s,
      but this couldn’t be further from the truth. Instead, <strong>80% of
	consumers will unsubscribe from a brand they believe is sending too
	many marketing messages</strong>.</p>

    <p>However, you don’t want to wait so long between emails that your
      readers forget about your business. The goal is for customers to
      <strong>associate your business with perfectly timed content or offers</strong>,
      not drive them away by annoying them. <strong>Monitoring your customer
	engagement data can help you figure out the best time and frequency</strong>
      to send out your emails.</p>

    <p>You also need to be aware of <strong>when you’re sending out certain
	content</strong>. Too many promotional messages or irrelevant information
      loses your readers’ attention. Instead, <strong>strike a balance between
	sending emails that engage your customers with topics and promotions
	that are relevant to their interests and needs</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Data Is Critical</h2>

    <p>Using metrics to monitor how your readers respond to an email campaign
      is <strong>vital if you want to develop an effective marketing
	strategy</strong>. In fact, <strong>measuring various customer engagement metrics</strong>
      can help your team overcome any uncertainty over the impact of your
      marketing efforts.</p>

    <p>By collecting <strong>email marketing data</strong>, you can get to know your
      customer to determine the <strong>optimal send frequency</strong>, evaluate their
      <strong>interest in the email content</strong>, and <strong>track noticeable changes in
	behavior</strong>. Plus, you can filter out or attempt to re-engage inactive
      subscribers.</p>

    <p>Having <strong>actionable reports lets you continually shape your emails</strong>
      so you can make better informed marketing decisions and <strong>maximize
	customer engagement</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Content Is Key</h2>

    <p>Once you’ve determined the <strong>best send times and analyzed readers’
	behavior</strong>, ensure your content will keep them coming back. Your
      emails need to <strong>resonate with your customers while also being
	convenient and easy to read on their devices</strong>. A subscriber might be
      interested enough to open one message, but if your email content
      <strong>isn’t optimized for mobile devices, fails to run smoothly or load
	quickly, or has errors and typos, they won’t click on the next
	one</strong>. Always <strong>check your content quality</strong> so they want to see more.</p>

    <p>With so many emails vying for your readers’ attention, how can you
      make sure your messages stand out? By <strong>writing tailored
	messages</strong>. Personalization means more than just including the
      reader’s name in the text, it means <strong>customizing each email to a
	subscriber’s individual needs and interests</strong>.</p>

    <p>This level of personalization could mean <strong>offering a customer the
	right product or service when they need it most or having an
	interactive feature in the message that feeds informative analytics
	data back to you</strong>. Using an <strong>email marketing service provider can
	also provide insights that make creating personalized content more
	accessible</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you want to <strong>overcome digital fatigue to reach your readers</strong>, you
      need to understand how to use <strong>timing, metrics, and content
	together</strong>. By sending the <strong>right content at the right time</strong>, you
      can <strong>grab your customers’ attention and build a fruitful
	relationship</strong>.</p>
