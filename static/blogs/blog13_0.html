    <p><strong>April has just started, and National Financial Literacy Month is here.</strong></p>

    <p><em>3 min. read</em></p>

    <p>April has just started, and <strong>National Financial Literacy Month is here</strong>. This month, originally designated to tackle <strong>American youths’ lagging financial literacy</strong>, provides an opportunity to <strong>educate the newest generation entering adulthood: Generation Z</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Who are Gen Z?</h2>

    <p>Gen Z, sometimes called <strong>Zoomers</strong>, are the newest generation entering adulthood. Currently, between the ages of <strong>9 and 24</strong>, they’re predicted to be the <strong>largest generation in the U.S., with an estimated 78 million members by 2034</strong>.</p>

    <p>In <strong>2019</strong>, they already represented about <strong>40% of the nation’s consumer purchasing power</strong> despite more than half the generation being children. They possess the <strong>greatest global purchasing potential of any other generation to date</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How is Gen Z’s financial literacy?</h2>

    <p>While we’ve discussed the importance of financial literacy in adults, <strong>Gen Z’s unique tech upbringing has given this generation a mixed understanding of finances</strong>. Many Zoomers have been using smartphones since before they were teenagers. So far, <strong>50-80% of Gen Z that own a smartphone use mobile banking</strong>.</p>

    <p>Some studies have even found that <strong>Gen Z was three times more likely to take a financial education class than millennials</strong>. Despite this statistic, <strong>almost half of Gen Zers rely on their parents for financial advice</strong>. Less than a third uses <strong>financial services companies or financial websites for information</strong>, which explains why older generations pass down many of their misconceptions about finances to Zoomers.</p>

    <p>Additionally:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>57% of Gen Z report they don’t know how much money they have in savings</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Almost 70% are confused over how much they can spend now versus saving for later</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Over a quarter believe they don’t need to build credit or invest in retirement</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>These facts highlight the confusion and misinformation <strong>Zoomers — a generation that can reshape the financial industry — have about financial literacy</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How can you connect with Gen Z?</h2>

    <p>Zoomers are uncertain about their finances, with <strong>28% feeling “bad” about their money situation — more than any other generation</strong>. Due to their <strong>lack of confidence in money matters</strong>, Gen Z visits bank branches <strong>in person more often than millennials and at four times the rate of people 55 and older</strong>.</p>

    <p>Their <strong>frequent branch visits open the door for more hands-on opportunities</strong> for your organization to fill in the gaps and correct misconceptions about their finances. To get started, try these <strong>three tips</strong>:</p>

    <h3>1. Give Gen Zers a treat to keep them coming back.</h3>

    <p>Over <strong>39% of Gen Z feel it’s at least a small bit important that banks offer free goodies</strong> (over twice the rate of millennials and Gen X, and almost eight times more than Baby Boomers). Those who are provided treats <strong>report visiting the bank more frequently than those who don’t</strong>.</p>

    <p>So don’t be afraid to offer <strong>delicious bait, such as candies or coffee</strong>, to grab their attention and maybe gain a loyal customer.</p>

    <h3>2. Help them learn about their finances.</h3>

    <p>Almost <strong>half of Gen Z surveyed said they found financial topics at least somewhat interesting</strong>. Around a <strong>third claimed to have taken a financial class</strong>, though many who did still had unanswered financial questions. <strong>Providing a financial education is a great opportunity to engage with your Zoomer customers.</strong></p>

    <h3>3. Connect with them over email.</h3>

    <p>Finally, despite growing up in the ever-evolving age of social media, <strong>research shows that the best channel for a brand to reach out to Gen Z is good old email</strong>.</p>

    <p>Use a <strong>comprehensive newsletter</strong> to reach out and educate your younger customers about important financial topics. Take the time to <strong>tailor the information to your audience</strong>, consider which topics will resonate best with them, and <strong>build a solid relationship</strong>. Just be sure to <strong>keep your financial information compliant with regulatory guidelines</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>National Financial Literacy Month provides a great opening to engage with a new generation of customers who are still learning the ropes. Reach out to your Zoomer customers today to help build relationships and improve your brand.</strong></p>
