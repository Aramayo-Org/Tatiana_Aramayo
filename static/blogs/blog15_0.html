    <p><strong>People really don’t like talking about money.</strong></p>

    <p><em>3 min. read</em></p>

    <h2>Banker Speaking With Customers</h2>

    <p>People really don’t like talking about money. In fact, a <strong>2018 study by the Capital Group</strong> revealed most respondents would rather discuss <strong>religion, politics, or even their own marital issues</strong> than income, savings, or debt.</p>

    <p>That’s fine when you’re avoiding uncomfortable conversations at the Thanksgiving table, but it becomes a problem for your bank when you’re trying to <strong>market your financial services</strong>. Attracting eyes and ears is hard enough. Getting people to pay attention to something they’d rather turn away from requires a whole new level of dedication.</p>

    <p>Fortunately, there are resources at your disposal you can use to show your customers that their finances <strong>don’t have to be taboo</strong>. Here are some tips to reach a reluctant audience without scaring them away.</p>

    <h2>Make Finance Easy to Understand</h2>

    <p>Despite being an integral part of our daily lives, <strong>personal finance can seem largely inaccessible</strong> to many. This can make banking promotions more frustrating than helpful for customers lacking sufficient financial literacy.</p>

    <p>Rather than bombarding your customers with <strong>overly-wordy content</strong> that is bound to go unopened or ignored, take the time to <strong>educate your audience</strong>. Engaging your customers requires a <strong>common language</strong> that doesn’t waste time with industry terms or jargon. <strong>Digestible, comprehensive email newsletters</strong> will get readers up to speed and make them more responsive to promotional material in the future.</p>

    <p>Not only are audiences more likely to read <strong>easily accessible content</strong>, but they will become more <strong>receptive to future messaging</strong> as their knowledge base expands. Provide your audience with <strong>key skills at no cost today</strong>, and they will return the favor tenfold with <strong>years of customer loyalty.</strong></p>

    <h2>Don’t Overwhelm Your Customers</h2>

    <p>Remember, even after you’ve beaten out other banks, you’re still competing with <strong>thousands of other businesses across a multitude of industries for attention</strong>. In order to stand out in the waves of marketing materials flooding inboxes every day, you need to prioritize <strong>quality over quantity</strong>.</p>

    <p>Take the time to <strong>identify the most important tenets of your value proposition</strong> and distribute content accordingly. Ensure your content offers <strong>genuine insights, not just promotions</strong>.</p>

    <p>You can achieve this with <strong>simplified language and educational materials</strong>, but an even more valuable tool is <strong>tailored messaging</strong>. By <strong>monitoring data to evaluate engagement levels</strong> on certain promotions or articles from specific recipients, you can <strong>fine-tune future content</strong> to be more likely to earn a response. If one of your customers has shown recent interest in the housing market, you wouldn’t send them the same offers you send to a customer who is researching car loans.</p>

    <p><strong>Ever-shortening attention spans demand timely, concise, and relevant marketing.</strong> Companies that fail to recognize this are doomed to end up in spam folders everywhere.</p>

    <h2>Build Rapport with Your Audience</h2>

    <p>Good news – despite their general hesitancy to discuss money, people are still <strong>most likely to turn to financial professionals when faced with a significant monetary decision.</strong> Still, that doesn’t mean your business can <strong>trade on name recognition alone to attract customers</strong>.</p>

    <p>Customers are naturally more inclined to trust a firm with their savings and investments when they <strong>feel connected to it</strong>. That means taking the time to <strong>cultivate a long-lasting relationship</strong>.</p>

    <p>The <strong>personalized content</strong> we’ve already discussed goes a long way in fostering goodwill, but building connections with people also requires a <strong>human touch</strong>. You can map out <strong>data analysis and target messaging like a science</strong>, but the writing itself is much more of an <strong>art form</strong>.</p>

    <p>If you want to educate a client, your content should convey <strong>patience and understanding</strong>. If you’re sharing a fantastic new promotion, mirror that <strong>excitement in your words</strong>. Striking the proper tone without seeming inauthentic is a challenge when reaching so many customers, so it can be useful to <strong>consult a team of professional writers who know your business inside and out</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Talking money can be scary.</strong> Reach out to your customers as a <strong>teacher and a friend</strong>, and banking will enter the conversation sooner than you think.</p>
