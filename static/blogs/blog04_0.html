    <p><strong>Ensure your dealership is ready to capitalize on an expected surge
	in RV travel demand as families seek safe, self-contained vacation
	options post-pandemic.</strong></p>

    <h2>RV Travel to Explode</h2>

    <p>If <strong>2020 and 2021</strong> were defined by consumers pulling back from
      leisure travel due to the pandemic’s social restrictions and economic
      uncertainty, then <strong>2022 is looking like the year for a rebound</strong>.</p>

    <p>That’s the message researchers and experts are getting from consumers,
      who are communicating across the board an <strong>increased desire to get
	back on the road</strong> and back to those special life experiences only
      travel can provide.</p>

    <p><strong>Outdoorsy</strong>, a community-driven marketplace for renting RVs directly
      from local owners, recently published a report with some key insights:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>91%</strong> of survey respondents say they’re planning to take a road
	trip in 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>83%</strong> of travelers would either be somewhat likely or very likely
	to vacation via RV or campervan if there were COVID surges in 2022.</li>
      <li><strong>68%</strong> of respondents feel that their families will need a road
	trip vacation more in 2022 than in previous years.</li>
      <li><p>Of the travelers surveyed:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>82%</strong> said they’re most likely to hit the road with their
	    significant other</li>
	  <li><strong>49%</strong> with their kids</li>
	  <li><strong>39%</strong> with their pets</li>
	  <li>Only <strong>7%</strong> reported a desire to travel solo</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>

    <p>This is only a sample of the available data, but it paints a clear and
      consistent picture: <strong>People – entire families – are mentally and
	emotionally exhausted</strong> by the events of the last two years, and they
      feel an acute need to “get away” in <strong>2022</strong>.</p>

    <p>The good news is, unlike <strong>2021</strong>, when there was hope but not
      certainty that COVID would recede by year’s end (which, unfortunately,
      did not bear out), we have a <strong>more concrete idea of what to expect in
	2022</strong>. Experts are saying that 2022 will almost certainly be the year
      that, thanks to <strong>rising global vaccination rates and newly available
	antiviral treatments</strong>, COVID will shift from a pandemic to being
      endemic — meaning the virus’s spread and accompanying hospitalizations
      will be <strong>perpetually manageable, like the seasonal flu</strong>.</p>

    <p>What this means for the RV industry is that the <strong>stars are aligning
	perfectly to see an explosion in demand in 2022</strong>, as the vast
      majority of people judge it to be safe enough to hit the road with
      their families.</p>

    <h2>Why RV Travel Is Well-Positioned</h2>

    <p>If there is a permanent change in people’s mindsets regarding leisure
      travel post-pandemic, it would be an <strong>increased emphasis on factors
	like cleanliness, safety, and convenience</strong> — all factors that play
      into <strong>RV-style, self-contained travel</strong>.</p>

    <p>In other words, as the pandemic ends and people are looking to
      decompress following some of the most stressful years any of us can
      remember, <strong>RVs are going to be exceptionally well-positioned</strong> as an
      alternative to crowded flights and expensive destinations.</p>

    <p>This demand will also dovetail with the <strong>growing enthusiasm for RVs,
	overlanding, and road-tripping</strong> in general that we’re seeing among
      <strong>millennials and Gen Z</strong>, meaning <strong>2022 could also represent a
	critical opportunity for retailers to make inroads with a new
	generation of consumers</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Is Your Financing Process As Smooth As It Can Be?</h2>

    <p>All of this begs the question: <strong>Is your dealership well positioned to
	capitalize on this increased demand?</strong> Are your <strong>sales and financing
	processes</strong> setting you up to <strong>minimize contracts-in-transit</strong> and
      eliminate time and resource waste?</p>

    <p>When demand surges, <strong>time is of the essence</strong>. One great way dealers
      can capture more profit is by <strong>streamlining the credit application
	and document preparation processes</strong> — in other words, the process of
      closing deals.</p>

    <p>That can be achieved with a <strong>solution that digitizes the financing
	process</strong> and establishes a <strong>web-based portal for both dealers and
	their lender partners to use</strong> — a solution that is <strong>free for dealers
	when conducting transactions with integrated lenders</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Final Takeaway</h2>

    <p>Dealers should <strong>strike while the iron’s hot</strong>, and <strong>2022 is looking
	like a hot year for leisure travel demand</strong>.  But remember: when you
      do strike, it should be from a <strong>place of strength and
	preparedness</strong>. Take the steps today to <strong>streamline your financing
	processes</strong> and position your dealership to capture as much profit as
      possible from every transaction.</p>
