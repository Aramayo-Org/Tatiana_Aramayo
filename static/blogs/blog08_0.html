<p><strong>Discover three growth strategies for credit unions, including
leveraging data analytics, embracing digitization, and nurturing key
relationships to stay competitive and boost profitability.</strong></p>

<p><em>By Chet Heughan</em> <br> <em>3 min. read</em></p>

<h2>Credit Union Growth</h2>

<p>From <strong>2018 to 2023</strong>, the U.S. credit union industry increased an
average of <strong>5.3% per year</strong> and is predicted to continue growing over
the next five years. With such a positive outlook, you might think
your credit union is set to grow with the market, but in reality it’s
not that easy.</p>

<p>The <strong>National Credit Union Administration’s 2022 Quarterly Data
Summary Report</strong> showed that the <strong>number of credit unions in the
fourth quarter declined</strong> over <strong>2021’s fourth quarter</strong>. This data
aligns with the industry’s <strong>long-running consolidation trend</strong>,
highlighting the <strong>high competition credit unions are facing</strong>.</p>

<p>If you want to see your financial institution grow, it’s important to
have a <strong>proactive plan</strong> that will allow your business to build a
strong network, adapt to sudden changes, and maximize profit
potential. Here are <strong>three strategies</strong> that can help your credit
union grow:</p>

<h2>1. Have a Smart Data Analytics Strategy</h2>

<p>In <strong>2021</strong>, one case study found that even though <strong>92% of companies
increased their investment into data analytics over the last decade</strong>,
less than <strong>30% saw transformational business outcomes</strong>. Furthermore,
most credit union leaders are <strong>not where they wanted to be in their
data analytics strategy plans</strong>, despite <strong>97% believing it’s
important</strong>.</p>

<p>The trick to a successful data strategy is <strong>how you incorporate that
data throughout your financial institution</strong>. Knowing how data
analytics can apply to <strong>every department</strong> helps your credit union
meet your desired business outcomes.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encourage a <strong>data-driven culture</strong> as part of your credit union’s
core values so all employees build their <strong>data literacy</strong>.</li>
<li>Employees can use insights from <strong>member behavior</strong> to improve
experiences, identify popular products or solutions, and discover
<strong>upcoming lending opportunities</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall, incorporating data analysis throughout your credit union
helps you adapt quickly to unpredictable situations and gives you a
competitive edge.</strong></p>

<h2>2. Embrace End-to-End Digitization</h2>

<p>Customers are looking for more <strong>digital solutions</strong> when interacting
with any business, with more than <strong>86% of customers wanting to
maintain or increase digital interactions</strong>. As a result, many credit
unions have placed <strong>improving digital member engagement</strong> as a top
strategic priority for <strong>2023</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Banks have saved approximately $7.3 billion</strong> just by
implementing chatbots to automate customer service.</li>
</ul>

<p>Establishing a <strong>well-rounded digital ecosystem</strong> can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Improve your members’ experience</li>
<li>Attract new members</li>
<li>Optimize the lending process</li>
<li>Improve your profit potential</li>
</ul>

<p>Creating and improving <strong>digital engagement</strong> is already a <strong>top
priority for many credit unions</strong>, and yours should be no
different. Knowing how to adopt <strong>digital tools and automation
solutions</strong> can increase your credit union’s <strong>efficiency and
profitability</strong>, giving you a <strong>competitive edge</strong> that will attract
even more potential members.</p>

<h2>3. Nurture Important Relationships</h2>

<p>Whether it’s being involved with your <strong>community</strong>, having
<strong>beneficial partners</strong>, or cultivating <strong>loyal members</strong>, it’s
important to understand how <strong>strong relationships can help your
credit union grow</strong>.</p>

<p>Top-performing credit unions gained their competitive advantage by
focusing on their relationships with:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Auto dealers</strong></li>
<li><strong>Real estate agents</strong></li>
<li>And more...</li>
</ul>

<p>These top performers also:</p>

<ul>
<li>Made it easier to do business with them</li>
<li>Maintained a strong <strong>community presence</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Because of their connections, they ranked in the <strong>top third among
their peers</strong> in terms of either <strong>return on assets, membership
growth, or loan growth</strong>.</p>

<p>When it comes to attracting new members or retaining existing ones,
<strong>understanding what they want is key</strong>. For instance, <strong>37% of credit
union members say they’re willing to pay a fee for a loyalty
program</strong>.</p>

<p>You can also <strong>redefine your relationships with vendors</strong> to offer
more <strong>innovative solutions</strong> to your members. This could mean teaming
up with a <strong>workflow and productivity solutions provider</strong> that will
make lending easier for both you and your customers.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>Knowing how to implement a <strong>smart data analytics strategy</strong>,
<strong>streamline digital solutions</strong>, and <strong>strengthen key relationships</strong>
can help you create a <strong>proactive growth plan</strong> for your credit union.</p>
