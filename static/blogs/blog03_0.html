    <p><strong>As global shortages create a volatile automotive market, dealerships
	have to rely on a great inventory management process to keep their
	stock fresh.</strong></p>

    <p><em>By KeyTrak</em> <br> <em>4 min. read</em></p>

    <h2>The Average Price of a New Vehicle Has Hit a Record High</h2>

    <p>The average price of a new vehicle in the United States recently hit a
      <strong>record high of over $47,000</strong> — nearly <strong>$10,000 more than two
	years ago</strong> thanks to current global shortages and high demand. This
      has resulted in an overall <strong>drop in new car sales in favor of used
	car sales</strong>, as many customers choose to save money purchasing older
      vehicles.</p>

    <p>There’s never been a more profitable time to sell a vehicle than now,
      with many vehicles selling before they even touch the lot.</p>

    <p><strong>So why should you worry about properly managing your aging inventory
	when business is booming?</strong></p>

    <p>Because this high demand won’t last and your dealership could find
      itself stuck with a rapidly depreciating inventory when global
      shortages end. While your sales strategy has likely adapted to ride
      the profit waves of these abnormal market conditions by creating
      <strong>waitlists and increasing your used car stock</strong>, your dealership may
      be unprepared for a <strong>return to normal market conditions</strong>.</p>

    <p>Establishing procedures now to properly <strong>monitor your inventory</strong>
      plays a vital role in keeping your dealership <strong>agile in volatile
	market conditions</strong>. Doing so allows you to quickly adjust your
      <strong>marketing strategy and your stock inventory</strong> to better appeal to
      changing consumer behaviors.</p>

    <h2>Know Your Inventory to Stay Fresh</h2>

    <p>With <strong>new cars selling out faster than they can be made</strong>, many
      dealers are quick to snap up trade-in deals to bulk up their used
      vehicle stock. Customers are able to get more value in these
      transactions as dealers are more willing to pay higher prices for used
      cars. This is only possible because of the overall rise in vehicle
      prices, ensuring dealers can <strong>maintain their profit margins despite
	paying more</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>But what do you think will happen when the market value for these
	vehicles returns to normal before you sell them?</strong></p>

    <p>When the market shifts back to normal, your dealership could be stuck
      with an inventory filled with older vehicles <strong>losing their value
	quickly</strong>. <strong>Knowing your inventory is key</strong> to quick and informed
      thinking that allows you to plan optimal <strong>sales and marketing
	strategies</strong> for pushing the sale of aging stock as quickly as
      possible to minimize profit loss.</p>

    <h2>Don’t Rely on Your Waitlists</h2>

    <p>Do you have a lengthy waitlist? Don’t count on that business.</p>

    <p>Dealers face <strong>false demand from customers</strong> who put down deposits at
      multiple dealerships, only intending to do business with the
      dealership that delivers the vehicle first. Once they have the
      vehicle, they’ll <strong>cancel the rest of their orders</strong>.</p>

    <p>This scenario may not seem dangerous with current high demand
      compensating for these lost sales, but you risk facing <strong>margin
	compression</strong> the moment your dealership is left with <strong>sitting
	inventory</strong>.</p>

    <h2>Make Your Marketing a Priority</h2>

    <p>It’s important to maintain <strong>effective marketing</strong> even in times of
      high demand, as customers can easily overlook your dealership with so
      much competition online. Now is the time to <strong>improve your marketing</strong>
      and push your dealership ahead of the pack so you can maintain high
      profits beyond <strong>2022</strong>.</p>

    <p><strong>Customers won’t buy your vehicles if they don’t know you have
	them.</strong></p>

    <p>It’s imperative for your dealership to have a strategy to market
      vehicles at <strong>most risk of losing value from lower demand</strong> before
      you’re forced to pay the price of keeping an aging inventory.</p>

    <h2>Plan for Customers to Drive Their Vehicles Longer</h2>

    <p>Despite current high demand in new and used cars, the general trend of
      the <strong>average age of vehicles</strong> has increased in recent years, mainly
      due to <strong>improved vehicle quality</strong> in the past 15 years. People are
      holding on to their vehicles longer and longer, with the <strong>average age
	of vehicles on the road in the United States hitting a record 12.1
	years</strong>. Nowadays, most customers prefer <strong>repairing their vehicles
	rather than replacing them</strong>.</p>

    <p><img src="blog03_keytrak_B.jpg" style="width: 100%; max-width: 1000px;" alt="Auto Blog Post Stat (1)" /></p>

    <p>It’s likely this market trend will continue, especially since, as
      mentioned before, the <strong>overall rate of new vehicle sales is
	dropping</strong>. Even when the market shortages are over, consumers may not
      jump back into purchasing vehicles even if prices drop, leaving your
      dealership at risk of having a stock of <strong>unwanted vehicles</strong>.</p>

    <h2>The Importance of a Great Inventory Management Process</h2>

    <p>To stay agile, take the time to ensure your dealership’s <strong>inventory
	management process includes vehicle reporting features</strong> to help you
      identify aging stock. You should be able to quickly determine <strong>which
	vehicles have been sitting on your lot for long periods of time.</strong></p>

    <p>For example, when a customer comes in for a test drive, you could use
      your <strong>key management system</strong> to look up the vehicle that matches a
      customer’s request. Then, you could also run a report displaying lists
      of similar vehicles that have been in stock longer.</p>

    <p>Your system should compare the <strong>days a car has been in stock</strong> with
      the rest of your inventory, giving you the chance to prioritize
      selling aging inventory to customers most likely to buy.</p>

    <p>The last thing you want is to be stuck with a lot full of unsold cars
      when demand drops again. With the <strong>right system</strong>, you can set up
      your dealership for <strong>future success</strong>.</p>
