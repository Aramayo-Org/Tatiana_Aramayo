    <p><strong>In the United States, millennials and Gen Z are currently the two

    <p>In the United States, <strong>millennials and Gen Z are currently the two
	largest population groups of all generations</strong>, with <strong>72.2 million
	and 69.6 million people, respectively</strong>. Together, these generations
      have an <strong>unprecedented impact on the economy</strong> that will only grow as
      more members of Gen Z reach adulthood.</p>

    <p>Being aware of how younger customers <strong>view and handle their
	finances</strong> is essential for any bank or credit union looking to
      <strong>engage with younger generations</strong>. If your financial institution
      wants to stay competitive with the world’s largest growing customer
      base, you’ll need to know how to <strong>stay relevant and meet their unique
	needs</strong>.</p>

    <h2>How Do Millennials and Gen Z Feel About Their Finances?</h2>

    <p>It’s already tricky to talk about money with customers when so many
      adults today <strong>consider finances a taboo topic</strong>. But this social
      stigma has a negative effect on your customers’ ability to manage
      their finances, with <strong>57% of Americans noting that their lack of
	financial literacy has impacted their financial future</strong>.</p>

    <p>On top of that, <strong>finances are confusing to most people</strong>. One survey
      asked Americans to indicate the most confusing financial tasks and
      found that:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Nearly 27% marked taxes</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Over 24% marked retirement</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Almost 18% marked buying a home</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Plus, <strong>recent inflation has caused over 18% of adults to cut back or
	pause saving for retirement</strong>, and <strong>over 32% stopped contributing to
	their emergency fund</strong>.</p>

    <p>Additionally, <strong>younger generations tend to struggle more with
	managing their finances</strong>, with more than half of millennials and Gen
      Z <strong>labeling themselves as emotional spenders</strong>, resulting in:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Two-thirds of both generations taking on debt</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Nearly 40% of Gen Z stating their emotional spending is out of
	  control</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Plus, they’re more likely to use <strong>buy now, pay later services</strong> and
      use <strong>mobile cash advance apps</strong> than older generations.</p>

    <p>This <strong>lack of financial awareness could mean your younger customers
	are at higher risk of falling into poor financial
	health</strong>. Furthermore, a recent study found that <strong>73% of millennials
	and 66% of Gen Z live paycheck to paycheck</strong>. Younger generations are
      likely <strong>avoiding thinking about their financial state due to recent
	economic uncertainties</strong> and will need more guidance on how to manage
      their finances.</p>

    <h2>What Can You Do to Help Millennials and Gen Z Face Their Finances?</h2>

      finances, and <strong>providing the resources they need builds their
	confidence, which helps your bank or credit union’s bottom
	line</strong>. Follow these tips to help your customers become financially
      aware:</p>
