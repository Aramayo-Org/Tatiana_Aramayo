customer base, and less competition.</strong></p>

<h2>Know About Recreational Lending</h2>

<p>For a time, recreational lending lacked the familiar <strong>infrastructure,
data, and tools</strong> you see in the automotive industry. Understandably,
this lack of resources and information might have kept you, as well as
other lenders, away from the <strong>recreational lending industry</strong>.</p>

<p>But now the <strong>RV, powersports, and marine markets</strong> have grown
<strong>strong and profitable</strong>. And you have access to a <strong>library of
information and tools</strong> ready to help you jump into recreational
lending.</p>

<p>In fact, recreational lending has <strong>unique qualities you can
capitalize on</strong> as a lender to close more deals with <strong>lower
risks</strong>. Knowing more about recreational lending is a smart move if
you want to <strong>expand into these new markets</strong> and <strong>gain new members
to increase your profit potential</strong>.</p>

<h2>1. An Established and Mature Market</h2>

<p>Recreational dealerships have been around for a while, and as this
industry continues to grow, you have an opportunity to take advantage
of this <strong>maturing market</strong>. Over time, more and more <strong>historical and
performance loan data</strong> is being published, making it easier for you
to view <strong>profit potential</strong>.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>RV dealerships are projected to continue growing at astounding rates
and show good longevity.</li>
<li>In the last 20 years, the number of RV owners has increased over
<strong>62%</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>9.6 million households</strong> have expressed a desire to buy an RV in
the next five years.</li>
</ul>

<p>Furthermore:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>powersports market</strong> size was valued at almost <strong>$40 billion
in 2020</strong> and is projected to reach over <strong>$52 billion by 2028</strong>.</li>
<li>Companies like <strong>RV Retailer</strong> and <strong>Camping World</strong> are expanding
their businesses and improving their operations and financing.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over time, the <strong>recreational industry has grown and matured</strong>. With
these studies and reports, you can see for yourself the <strong>potential
profits</strong> lending in these markets holds for you. This is <strong>no longer
a new industry</strong>, and many lenders have already operated their
programs here successfully for years.</p>

<p>Being able to access a <strong>reliable network of recreational dealers</strong>
gives you an edge when venturing into this <strong>well-established
market</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. A Reliable Customer Base</h2>

<p>On average, a customer’s credit score for a good automotive loan is
around <strong>660 or higher</strong>. However, to qualify for an RV loan,
customers typically need a <strong>credit score of at least 700</strong>.</p>

<p>Since <strong>RVs, powersports vehicles, and marine vehicles</strong> are
considered <strong>luxury items</strong>, you can set <strong>higher standards for your
lending guidelines</strong>. Overall, a <strong>recreational customer tends to have
better economic and financial status</strong> compared to the average
automotive customer.</p>

<p><strong>Recent data on recreational customers shows:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Nearly <strong>60% of RV owners have an average income over $65K</strong>.</li>
<li>The median income for households that purchase powersports vehicles
is over <strong>$100K</strong>.</li>
<li>Consumers with an average income over <strong>$100K accounted for 93% of
boat loans in 2020</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These customers are generally <strong>more reliable</strong>, which lowers your
<strong>overall risk as a lender</strong>. In fact, reported loan delinquencies for
marine and RV loans were <strong>0.78% and 0.58% in Q2 2021</strong> — more than
<strong>1% lower than the 2.09% indirect automotive loan delinquency</strong>
reported in that time.</p>

<p>Since your members are in a <strong>better position to honor their loans</strong>,
you can <strong>charge higher interest rates and gain higher yields</strong>. Plus,
customers interested in purchasing a vehicle in this industry are
<strong>more likely to do so when they have stable financial status</strong>, which
<strong>eliminates subprime loans</strong> in this business.</p>

<h2>3. A Less Competitive Market</h2>

<p>In the U.S., the number of <strong>automotive dealerships has ranged between
16,000 and 17,000</strong> over the last several years. The number of
<strong>motorcycle dealerships</strong> was only about <strong>7,000</strong>, meaning dealers
typically have <strong>one to four competitors nearby</strong>.</p>

<p>This high concentration of automotive dealers means lenders face
<strong>countless local and regional competitors</strong> compared to lenders in
the powersports industry. Plus, <strong>recreational lenders don’t have to
compete with manufacturer captive finance companies</strong> like in the
automotive industry.</p>

<p>To increase your <strong>competitive advantage</strong> even further, tap into an
established <strong>network of recreational dealers</strong> using a <strong>web-based
platform like AppOne</strong>. This tool lets your business <strong>automatically
connect to customers at any dealership in network</strong>, giving you an
<strong>edge over lenders not in network</strong>.</p>

<h2>Final Thought</h2>

<p>The <strong>recreational lending industry has matured</strong> into a <strong>strong and
profitable market</strong> for lenders willing to capitalize on its <strong>unique
qualities</strong>. By taking the time to <strong>learn more about this industry</strong>
and how to utilize the <strong>best lending workflow tools available</strong>,
you’ll be able to <strong>jump into this market with confidence and increase
your profits</strong>.</p>
