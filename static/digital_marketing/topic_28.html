      <p>Per the Google course:</p>
      <p><em>"L’Acier is an online cookware retailer that sells affordable, restaurant-quality kitchen tools and equipment for home cooks. The company has an international customer base, so they run paid advertising and social media campaigns 24 hours a day, seven days a week. L’Acier’s digital marketing leadership is pleased with the amount of website traffic these campaigns are generating. However, the average number of new accounts created each week is lower than expected.
	  One of the company’s marketing goals for this quarter is to maximize the number of accounts created. The company is focusing heavily on growth because they’ve found that potential customers who create accounts make purchases more frequently and have a much higher customer lifetime value, which is the average revenue generated by customers over a certain period of time."</em></p>
      <p>In this activity, my team plans to run additional ads offering a one-time discount to customers who create a new account. My job is to examine the performance data for the past month to determine when is the best time to run these ads. This includes sorting and filtering the campaign data to answer questions about how the ads performed over the past moth.</p>
