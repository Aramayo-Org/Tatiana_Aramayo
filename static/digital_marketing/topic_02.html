      <p>In this exercise, I'm part of the digital marketing team sent to help a company improve its search engine optimization (SEO). This includes updating page titles and meta descriptions to better reflect the content of each webpage.</p>
      <p>Per the Digital Marketing course, the company for this activity is:
	<br><br>
	<em>"Founders’ Dairy is a specialty foods retailer located in Burlington, Vermont, USA. They began as a small farm in 1873, selling milk and cheeses to their local community. Since then, they have grown to include several brick-and-mortar shops, as well as an online store that ships nationwide. Founders’ Dairy sells a range of cheeses, jams, meats, syrups, and baked goods. They are especially well-known for their smoked cheddar cheeses and small-batch maple syrup."</em>
	<br><br>
	Here I have made recommendations for two pages for Founders' Dairy: the product page for buying cheese online and a page of recipes that uses Founders' products.
