      <p><em>"Baba’s is an independently-owned Gullah restaurant in South Carolina. They have recently launched a new line of proprietary spice blends. Currently, they only sell these products in their restaurant. However, to help achieve the company’s business goal to raise annual sales by 10% over the previous year, they plan to also sell the product line on the company’s website. You are responsible for running social media and email campaigns to increase website traffic and conversions, as measured by the CTR and CVR.
	  • The <strong>CTR</strong> (click-through rate) is the number of clicks that an ad receives divided by the number of times an ad is shown (impressions).
	  • The <strong>CVR</strong> (conversion rate) is the number of conversions that an ad receives divided by the total number of ad interactions (clicks)."</em></p>
      <p>In this activity, I'm responsible for running social media and email campaigns to increase website traffic and conversions, as measured by the click-through rate (CTR) and conversion rate (CVR). I've crafted the optimal performance goals for these campaigns based on Baba's Q4 marketing goals, KPIs, Q3 performance, and industry averages.</p>
      <p>To do this, I calculated the Q3 CTR and CVR based on the provided performance data and compared those results to the industry averages to set the Q4 performance goals.</p>
