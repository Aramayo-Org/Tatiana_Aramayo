      <p>Per the Google course:</p>
      <p><em>"Home, an upscale furniture retailer that does most of its business online. The company is launching a new line of furniture called For All, which is designed to expand their customer base. The For All line features the brand’s high level of craftsmanship, but at a lower price point than their previous offerings. Feels Like Home’s main business goal for the For All line is to grow their total active customer base by 30% within a year of launch."</em></p>
      <p>In this activity, I'm in charge of the email campaign for the launch of this new line. The email marketing goals to support Feel Like Home's overall business goals are:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>Grow the email subscriber list by the end of September</li>
	<li>Increase the monthly email conversion rate</li>
      </ul>
      <p>My task was to convert these goals into SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-Bound) goals using information from the meeting notes.</p>
