      <p>In this activity, I'm an e-commerce specialist that works for an online fine arts supplies company.</p>
      <p>Per the Google course:</p>
      <p><em>"Recently, the company conducted market research and identified craft supplies, such as yarn or candle-making supplies, as an area of growth and opportunity.<br>
	  After identifying craft supplies as a new product opportunity, the company reviewed the internal site search data for their website and discovered an increase in the number of customers searching for craft supplies over the past year. A majority of the search terms that customers used are related to one of three categories: yarn, jewelry making, and candle making.<br>
	  The company wants to know which of these categories received the highest number of searches so that they can begin researching the products within this category and decide if theyâ€™re worth selling."</em></p>
      <p>My task was to review a list of search terms used by customers that relate to craft supplies, select a category for each term, and identify which category received the highest number of searches. To do this, I made the summations of each category through the spreadsheet.</p>
